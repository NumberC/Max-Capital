# Max Capital

## About
We are a small team of game creator and game lovers particularly for a fantastic fan game called Fortune Street.  As of the beginning of the Corona pandemic we were stuck into a corner no longer able to play our favorite game since it is entirely local.  That is when inspiration struck.  We decided to create our own game inspired by Fortune Street, while adding our own creative touch with the explicit missions statement of easy modability, online play, and streamlined and improved features.  We are very excited for this project and hope you are two.  In the meantime we will see you on the stock market.

## How to Contribute

Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/zzGwcQxCjj) to discuss any development. Features and issues should be reported in the "Issues" section of GitHub. 

### Developers
Please take an issue that has not been taken already and state that you are working on the issue. Please remember to document and comment your code. If you are uncomfortable or don't know where to begin in contributing code, reviewing the code of others and adding comments is helpful. 

### Artists
Any art is helpful! Currently, Max Capital lacks many features, such as:
- icon
- character concepts and designs
- 3D Models for each space

So far, characters are 2D. However, they may become 3D in the future. Each space is 3D, but currently a work in progress. This list is likely to change as time goes on. More info can be found on the Discord.

### Documentation
As the game gets more advanced and gets closer to release, more documentation will be needed and a wiki will be created. Feel free to document the spaces or general gameplay. 

### Public Relations
Once Max Capital is released, we will need help advertising the game and making it known to the general public. If you are a writer, you could help review or write about our project.

### Personal Website
If you are a web developer or have an interest for it, Max Capital does not currently have a website. If you are interested in helping to create it, we would love to see your designs or ideas.
